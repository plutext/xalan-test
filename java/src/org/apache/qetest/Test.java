     * A major goal of the Test class is to separate the act and
     * process of writing a test from it's actual runtime
     * implementation.  Testwriters should not generally need to
     * know how their test is being executed.
     * <ul>They should simply focus on defining:
     * <li>doTestFileInit: what setup has to be done before running
     * the testCases: initializing the product under test, etc.</li>
     * <li>testCase1, 2, ... n: individual, independent test cases</li>
     * <li>doTestFileClose: what cleanup has to be done after running
     * the test, like restoring product state or freeing test resources</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>This method returns a simple boolean status as a convenience.
     * In cases where you have a harness that runs a great many
     * tests that normally pass, the harness can simply check this
     * value for each test: if it's true, you could even delete any
     * result logs then, and simply print out a meta-log stating
     * that the test passed.  Note that this does not provide any
     * information about why a test failed (or caused an error, or
     * whatever) - that's what the info in any reports/logs are for.</p>
     * <p>If a test is aborted, then any containing harness needs not
     * finish executing the test.  Otherwise, even if part of a test fails,
     * you should let the whole test run through.  Note that aborting
     * a test may result in the reporter or logger output being
     * incomplete, which may make an invalid report file (in the case
     * of XMLFileLogger, for example).</p>
