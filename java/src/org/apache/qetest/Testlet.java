/**
 * Minimal interface defining a testlet, a sort of mini-test.
 * A Testlet defines a single, simple test case that is completely
 * independent.  Commonly a Testlet will perform a single 
 * test operation and verify it, usually given a set of test 
 * data to perform the operation on.  
 *
 * <p>This makes creating data-driven tests simpler, by separating 
 * the test algorithim from the definition of the test data.  Note 
 * that logging what happened during the test is already separated 
 * out into the Logger interface.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Testlets are used with Datalets, which provide a single set 
 * of data to execute this test case with.
 * For example:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>We define a Testlet that processes an XML file with a 
 *   stylesheet in a certain manner - perhaps using a specific 
 *   set of SAX calls.</li>
 *   <li>The Testlet takes as an argument a matching Datalet, that 
 *   defines any parameters that may change  - like the names 
 *   of the XML file and the stylesheet file to use.</li>
 *   <li>Test authors or users running a harness or the like can 
 *   then easily define a large set of Datalets for various 
 *   types of input files that they want to test, and simply 
 *   iterate over the set of Datalets, repeatedly calling 
 *   Testlet.execute().  Each execution of the Testlet will 
 *   be independent.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Testlets may provide additional worker methods that allow them 
 * to be easily run in varying situations; for example, a 
 * testwriter may have a Test object that calls a number of Testlets 
 * for it's test cases.  If one of the Testlets finds a bug, the 
 * testwriter can simply reference the single Testlet and it's 
 * current Datalet in the bug report, without having to reference 
 * the enclosing Test file.  This makes it easier for others to 
 * reproduce the problem with a minimum of overhead.</p>
