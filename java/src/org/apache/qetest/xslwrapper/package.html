      <dd><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan" target="_top">Xalan-J 1.x XSLT Processor</a></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>This package also provides a number of implementations 
    for varying XSLT processors, including Xalan-J 1.x, 
    Xalan-J 2.x using the TRAX interface, and others.<p>
    <p>This allows many test classes to eliminate dependencies 
    on a specific processor and be able to plug-and-play 
    different processors to compare test results.<p>
    <p>See ProcessorWrapper.properties for info on how a -flavor 
    can get mapped into a specific implementation and 'type' 
    of a ProcessorWrapper.</p>
