    <p>Most tests are completely generic to the TRAX interface, although they 
    do default System properties to use the Xalan-J 2.x implementation.<p>
    <ul>Current tests are primarily focused on covering the API's and include:
    <li>ProcessorAPITest - basic coverage of both factory methods and instance methods</li>
    <li>ResultAPITest</li>
    <li>TransformerAPITest</li>
    <li>TemplatesAPITest - also covers TemplatesBuilder class</li>
    <li>TestThreads - a semi-automated test for multithreaded testing, 
    results must be manually analyzed currently</li>
    </ul>
