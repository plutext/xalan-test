    <p>This package includes base classes and utilities, as well as several 
    generic test drivers that use {@link org.apache.qetest.xslwrapper.ProcessorWrapper ProcessorWrappers} 
    to process stylesheets.  Classes in this package must not depend directly 
    on any Xalan interfaces, only on the ProcessorWrapper interface.<p>
    <ul>Current utilities include:
    <li>Logging* - implementations of XSLT-related listeners 
    and the like that log to our Reporter.</li>
    <li>XHTFileCheckService, XHTComparator - checks equivalence of 
    two File objects by parsing either as XML, HTML, or text.  Note 
    the HTML parsing is unimplemented - we need a good HTML->DOM 
    parser we can use in Apache - any suggestions?</li>
    <li>XSLTestfileInfo - simple extension of TestfileInfo to 
    add xmlName member.</li>
    <li>XSLDirectoryIterator - simple implementation that processes 
    xsl/xml file pairs from a fileList or over a directory tree, 
    automatically comparing the result files with a known good 
    or 'gold' reference tree of outputs.</li>
    <li>XSLProcessorTestBase - adds useful XSLT processing 
    utilities, etc. from FileTestBase: including flags like 
    -preprocess, -flavor, -category, etc.  Most xsl and trax 
    package Test scripts derive from this class.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Current tests include:
    <li>ConformanceTest - generic test driver, including some 
    FilenameFilters.  This essentially uses the XSLDirectoryIterator 
    for everything.</li>
    <li>PerformanceTest - test driver that iterates repeatedly and 
    reports memory and timing info.</li>
    <li>CConformanceTest - generic test driver that constructs a 
    command line and then shells out to execute TestXSLT.exe, which 
    is from the Xalan-C build.  This allows basic comparisons of 
    results from the Java versions with the C++ versions.</li>
    </ul>
