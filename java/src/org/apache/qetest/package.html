      <dt><b>Goals: </b></dt><dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a solid, independent test framework.</li>
          <li>Encourage good testing/verification practices.</li>
          <li>Enable quicker generation of Xalan test cases.</li>
          <li>Simplify maintenance of test cases.</li>
          <li>Provide basic test results analysis frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

    <p>This package is primarily focused on the quality 
    engineer, and system or integration level tests that are to be 
    shared with a larger audience, rather than on a developer who 
    writes unit tests primarily for their own use.</p>
    <ul>A few of the basic design patterns/principles used:
    <li>Most objects can be initialized either through their 
    constructor or an initialize() method with a Properties 
    block of name=value pairs to setup their internal state 
    from.  Composite objects will typically pass their entire 
    Properties block to sub-objects or contained objects for 
    their own initializations.  One future drawback: need to 
    ensure the namespace doesn't have collisions between tests, 
    reporters, and loggers. Eventually I'd like to have a 
    'namespace' for just the tests themselves.</li>
    <li>Test, TestImpl, FileBasedTest: these all provide structure 
    and utility methods useful for testing in general.</li>
    <li>Testlet, Datalet: these small, focused mini-tests 
    that encourage creating data driven tests and allow you 
    to separate the specific testing algorithim used from 
    the set of data to execute it on.</li>
    <li>User subclasses of the Test classes should simply focus on 
    manipulating the product under test and calling log*() or check*() 
    methods to report information.  They shouldn't worry about the 
    external environment or managing their reporter unless they have 
    a specific reason to.</li>
    <li>Loggers simply provide a mechanisim to output data in a manner 
    so that the test doesn't have to manage the output at all.  They 
    ensure that all tests produce output in a common format, making it 
    easier to evaluate test results across many tests or products.  
    Loggers generally don't keep track of the test's result state, 
    relying on the user to analyze the result set later.</li>
    <li>Reporters act as a composite of Loggers, as well as providing 
    various useful utilities.  Reporters also keep a running track of 
    the pass/fail state of a Test during execution, as well as reporting 
    it out using their Loggers.</li>
    <li>CheckService is a generic service for checking 'equivalence' 
    of two objects and reporting the pass/fail/other result thereof.  
    A SimpleFileCheckService implementation is provided as an 
    example; we have plans to add various other kinds of checkers, 
    perhaps a DOMCheckService.</li>
    <li>OutputNameManager is a cheap-o helper for tests that create 
    a large number of consecutive output files.</li>
    <li>TestfileInfo is a simple data-holding class to store info 
    about a test data file.  It is used in FileBasedTest, which may 
    be a useful base class for your tests.  This should probably be 
    replaced with a Datalet which, along with Testlets, provides a 
    lighter-weight way to write tests.</li>
